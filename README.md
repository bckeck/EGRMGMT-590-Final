Fundamentals of Data Science - Project on building 'career event vectors' for individuals across multiple years, multiple activities, multiple sectors, and see how those match against salary changes.
----------
Cheryl,

Thank you for the feedback. We are going to use the Work Histories Italian Panel (WHIP). WHIP is a database of individual work histories, based on Inps administrative archives. The reference population is made up by all the people, Italian and foreign, who have worked in Italy even only for only a part of their working career. A large representative sample has been extracted from this population for a dynamic population of about 370,000 people.

The dataset tracks individuals over years with a reference “ID” variables that are tracked that we can analyze:
•	Contribution rebate eventually applied to the worker's contract.
•	Geographical area where employment was performed.
•	Number of paid working days equivalent to full time.
•	Illness benefits
•	Annual compensation
•	Industry work is performed
•	Skill Level - Apprentice, Blue Collar Worker, White Collar Worker, Cadre -high skilled White Collar-, Manager).

We are moving forward on this dataset to build 'career event vectors' for individuals across multiple years, multiple activities, multiple sectors, and see how those match against salary changes.

Please let us know if there are any concerns,
-Bryan, Jack, Michael
